#### Activities

Navigate - Track - Forage - Scout - Map - Keep Watch

#### Costs

1 mile = 20 minutes walking

1 km = 15 minutes walking

Difficult Terrain = double cost

Climbing, Swimming and Crawling cost double movement.

Strength is used to jump.

#### Challenge

Decision on **travel route**
1. Route is mutable but an initial plan is required

1. Character should be proficient in the skill
2. Skill cannot be repeated - two perception checks are not allowed
3. Player should narrate how the skill helps with the travel
    1. The skill DC will be set based on the narration
    2. DC is decreased if skills meet the roles of - Provisioner Navigator Scout

Dice decide the **outcome**
1. On 3 successes and 0 failures they reach their destination on time with \u201Ca story of love, a story of pain, a story of loss, a story of gain\u201D
2. On 3 successes and 1 failure they reach their destination with 50% extra travel time and one random non-combat encounter
3. On 3 successes and 2 failures they reach their destination with 50% extra travel time and one random combat encounter
4. On each additional failure until 3 successes
